### Overview of dependency libraries used by Nori

Nori requires several utility libraries to function correctly; a full list with
explanations is given below. You should feel free to use any of their
functionality in your own submissionsâ€”however, you are not required to do so.

* `filesystem`: tiny self-contained library for manipulating file paths
* `hypothesis`: utility functions for statistical hypothesis tests
* `nanogui`: minimalistic GUI library for OpenGL
* `openexr`: High dynamic range image format library
* `pcg32`: tiny self-contained pseudorandom number generator
* `pugixml`: light-weight XML processing library
* `tbb`: Intel's Boost Thread Building Blocks for multithreading
* `tinyformat`: type-safe C++11 version of `sprintf` and friends
* `zlib`: data compression library, used by `openexr`
